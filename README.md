My name is Fernando and I am currently a programming student, with a strong interest in joining a multinational company that allows me to enrich my knowledge and grow professionally.

As a continuous learning enthusiast, I focus on studying the most widely used programming languages today, with special attention to Python, both for developing solutions with artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as for automating repetitive tasks, optimizing processes that would normally take a lot of time.

Currently, I have an intermediate proficiency (around 60%) in technologies such as HTML5, CSS, Python, SQL, and Google Colab, in which I am constantly in the process of honing these skills.
